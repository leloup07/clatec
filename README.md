## Key Systems

### Escalation Logic (`system-prompt.js`)

Three layers: individual flags → compound triggers → escalation level.

**13 individual flags** with severity (critical/high/medium): retail investors, custody, ART/EMT, multi-jurisdiction, sandbox, exchange, advisory, CASP services, public marketing, large/significant transaction size.

**5 compound triggers** that weight more than the sum of parts:
- `retail + custody` → critical (most stringent MiCA requirements)
- `stableValue + large issuance` → critical (significant ART/EMT thresholds)
- `sandbox + crossborder` → critical (jurisdiction-specific permissions)
- `CASP + retail` → critical (full authorization + enhanced conduct)
- `exchange + custody` → high (potential DLT infrastructure)

**Escalation levels:** soft (1-2 flags) → medium (3-4 or 1 compound) → strong (5+ or critical compound). Strong escalation requires assumption confirmation before output.

### Case Guard (`guard.js`)

Six boundary categories enforced on every message:
- Definitive legal advice requests → soft block + redirect
- Document review/validation → soft block + redirect
- Regulatory evasion intent → hard block (second attempt = permanent block)
- Pure tax queries → soft block + scope exclusion
- Enforcement/sanctions matters → hard block + immediate exit
- Extreme risk with insufficient maturity → bypass to professional review

### Payment Flow

```
Select tier → Stripe checkout → Payment confirmed
→ KYC form (post-payment, pre-scheduling)
→ Calendly unlocked → Consultation scheduled
```

Two tiers: Structured Review (€450) and Complex Matter Review (€750). Fixed price, not hourly. Prepayment required. Calendar booking disabled until KYC complete.

### KYC

Activated ONLY when paid professional relationship begins. Not during intake, not during chat.
- Individuals: name, ID document, country of residence
- Entities: legal name, incorporation, representative, beneficial ownership (>25%)
- Risk flags: PEP status, non-EU jurisdictions

### Admin Panel (`/admin`)

Login → lead list with filters (status, matter type, urgency) → lead detail with full intake, chat history, internal notes, status management → metrics dashboard (totals, conversion rate, categories, urgency distribution).

2. Supabase project setup + schema execution
3. Stripe account configuration + webhook endpoint
4. Calendly setup + embed URL
5. Resend domain verification
6. Admin auth approach (placeholder password → Supabase Auth)
7. Timeline for Phase 1 deployment
